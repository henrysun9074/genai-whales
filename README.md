# genai-whales

Code repository for Smartwhales project/undergraduate honors thesis: "Generative diffusion models for dataset augmentation and cetacean detection"  

Contains information about running scripts for image batch generation using diffusers, data for diffusion model fine-tuning, and output synthetic images for training/testing object detection models. 

The README will be updated with information about reproducing results at a later date.
